# Team Claw

An autonomous AI software development team running in Docker. Seven Claude agents — each playing a real SDLC role — receive requirements, design, implement, test, review, and ship working code to GitHub without human intervention.

Built across 9 phases, from a minimal 2-agent loop to a full team with CI, human-in-the-loop escalation, live dashboard, and tool telemetry.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker + Docker Compose
- An Anthropic API key
- A GitHub token (for agents to push code)

### 1. Configure

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:

```env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_...
GITHUB_USERNAME=your-github-username
```

### 2. Start the team

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

All 10 containers start: Redis, Postgres, Sandbox, Orchestrator, and 7 agent containers.

### 3. Install the CLI

```bash
pip install httpx
```

### 4. Submit a task

```bash
python3 cli.py submit \
  "Build a REST API for a todo app" \
  "Create a FastAPI service with CRUD endpoints for todos. Include pytest tests. GitHub Repo: build-a-todo-app"
```

### 5. Watch the team work

```bash
python3 cli.py watch <thread_id>
```

Or open the live dashboard at `http://localhost:8080`.

---

## CLI Reference

```
python3 cli.py <command> [options]
```

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `submit "<title>" "<description>" [--priority high\|normal\|low]` | Submit a new task to the team |
| `watch <thread_id>` | Stream live messages for a thread (SSE) |
| `threads` | List all threads with status |
| `messages <thread_id>` | Print full message history for a thread |
| `standup [--hours N]` | Show what the team worked on in the last N hours (default: 24) |
| `budget <thread_id>` | Show token usage and budget bar for a thread |
| `tools [--agent role] [--thread id] [--limit N]` | Show tool execution history with stats |
| `questions [--thread <id>]` | List unanswered human questions (HITL) |
| `reply <thread_id> "<message>" [--to <agent_role>]` | Reply to a pending human question |

### Examples

```bash
# Submit a task
python3 cli.py submit "Build a Slack clone" "FastAPI with users, DMs, and group channels. GitHub Repo: my-slack-clone"

# Watch a thread live
python3 cli.py watch 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000

python3 cli.py questions

# Reply to an agent's question
python3 cli.py reply 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000 "Use PostgreSQL, not SQLite" --to senior_dev_1

# Check token usage
python3 cli.py budget 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
```

## Dashboard

Open `http://localhost:8080` for the live web dashboard:

- **Thread sidebar** — all threads with live status (active / waiting / complete)
- **Message feed** — real-time SSE stream of every inter-agent message
- **Context-aware chat bar** — submits a new task when no thread is selected; steers the active thread when one is selected (injects a human reply into the team's inbox)
- **Pending Questions panel** — shows unanswered `ask_human` questions; reply inline
- **CI results panel** — pass/fail per task with test counts
- **Kanban task board** — tasks per thread with status
- **Tool Activity panel** — last 8 tool calls with duration + top tools by call count
- **Budget bar** — token usage bar (green → amber → red) below the feed header
- **Agent heartbeat dots** — green/amber/gray per agent (30s heartbeat)
- **Standup modal** — one-click standup report

## How a Task Works

```
1. Human submits task via CLI or Dashboard
        ↓
2. Orchestrator creates thread → routes to Product Owner
        ↓
3. Product Owner refines requirements → sends to Engineering Manager
        ↓
4. Engineering Manager decomposes into tasks → assigns to Architect + Devs
        ↓
5. Architect reviews design decisions → reports back to EM
        ↓
6. Senior/Junior Devs implement → write tests → execute_code to verify
        ↓
7. Each Dev: git_status → git_commit → git_push → task_complete to EM
        ↓
8. EM receives all task_complete → git_merge feature branches → git_push main
        ↓
9. EM marks tasks done → CI runs in sandbox (pytest)
        ↓
10. CI passes → _auto_complete_thread() fires → thread status: complete
        ↓
11. Dashboard shows ✅ complete; GitHub repo has working code
```

If an agent is blocked or requirements are ambiguous, they call `ask_human` → thread enters `waiting` status → human replies via CLI or dashboard → thread resumes.

---

## Thread Lifecycle

```
submitted → active → (waiting) → active → complete
                         ↑
                  ask_human called;
                  human reply resumes
```

Threads can also be manually closed via the dashboard (🔒 button) or `POST /threads/{id}/close`.

## What's Been Built (Phase History)

| Phase | What was added |
|-------|----------------|
| 1 | Foundation: Redis + Postgres + base Dockerfile, 2-agent loop (EM ↔ Sr Dev) |
| 2 | Full 7-agent team, all roles, code execution sandbox, Junior Devs |
| 3 | Context summarization, git tools (`git_status`, `git_commit`, `git_push`, `git_merge`), live dashboard |
| 4 | Shared `/workspace` volume, wiki tools, agent memory, artifact tracking |
| 5 | Agent heartbeats, Kanban task board, auto-CI (pytest in sandbox) |
| 6 | CI quality gate (blocks `done` if CI failed), webhooks, thread auto-completion |
| 7 | `search_code`, `find_files`, `check_budget` tools; standup report; budget bar in dashboard |
| 8 | `edit_file` tool, tool telemetry (duration + success per call), thread close endpoint, idle thread alerts |
| 9 | Human-in-the-loop: `ask_human` tool, `human_questions` table, pending questions panel, `git_diff` tool, context-aware chat bar (new task vs. steer mode), `questions`/`reply` CLI commands |

---

## Tips

**Including a GitHub repo in your task** ensures agents push code when done:
```
"... GitHub Repo: build-a-todo-app"
```

**Steering a running task** — select the thread in the dashboard and type in the chat bar, or:
```bash
python3 cli.py reply <thread_id> "Switch from SQLite to PostgreSQL"
```

**Checking for questions** — agents call `ask_human` when genuinely blocked:
```bash
python3 cli.py questions
python3 cli.py reply <thread_id> "Your answer here"
```

**Watching costs** — each agent reports token usage; budget bars turn amber at 80%, red at 100%.
